# Pycaret-Classification-
PyCaret is a low-code machine learning library that simplifies the process of building and deploying classification models. It automates key steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

For classification tasks, PyCaret supports various models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. It also provides built-in functions for handling imbalanced datasets, evaluating model performance using metrics like Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and MCC, and seamlessly deploying models.

With PyCaret, users can compare multiple classifiers with a single function, fine-tune them efficiently, and generate insightful visualizations, making it a powerful tool for both beginners and experienced data scientists.
